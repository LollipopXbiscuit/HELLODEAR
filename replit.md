# Overview

This is a Telegram character catcher bot called "Waifu & Husbando Catcher" that operates as a gamified character collection system. The bot sends anime character images to Telegram groups after every 100 messages, and users can guess the character names to add them to their personal collections. The system includes trading, gifting, favorites, and leaderboard features to create an engaging community-driven game.

# System Architecture

## Core Bot Framework
- **Telegram Bot API**: Uses python-telegram-bot v20.6 for main bot functionality and command handling
- **Pyrogram**: Secondary Telegram client library for additional features like admin controls and message handling
- **Dual Client Pattern**: Implements both python-telegram-bot (application) and Pyrogram (shivuu) clients for different use cases

## Database Design
- **MongoDB with Motor**: Async MongoDB driver for all data persistence
- **Collections Structure**:
  - `anime_characters_lol`: Stores character data (id, name, anime, rarity, image URL)
  - `user_collection_lmaoooo`: User's collected characters
  - `user_totals_lmaoooo`: User statistics and totals
  - `group_user_totalsssssss`: Group-specific user statistics
  - `top_global_groups`: Global group leaderboards
  - `total_pm_users`: Private message users tracking

## Message Processing Architecture
- **Message Counter System**: Tracks messages per group with customizable frequency (default 100 messages)
- **Async Locks**: Prevents race conditions using asyncio locks per chat
- **Character Spawning**: Automatic character deployment based on message thresholds
- **Spam Prevention**: Built-in rate limiting and spam counters

## Command System
- **Modular Design**: Commands organized in separate modules for maintainability
- **Admin Controls**: Role-based permissions using Pyrogram's chat member status
- **User Commands**: `/guess`, `/fav`, `/trade`, `/gift`, `/collection`, `/topgroups`
- **Admin Commands**: `/upload`, `/changetime`, `/broadcast`

## Caching Strategy
- **TTL Cache**: Uses cachetools for temporary data storage
- **User Collection Cache**: 60-second TTL for frequently accessed user data
- **Character Cache**: 10-hour TTL for character data
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields

## Rarity System
- **Tiered Rarity**: 4-tier system (Common ‚ö™Ô∏è, Medium üü¢, Rare üü£, Legendary üü°)
- **Auto-incrementing IDs**: Sequence-based character ID generation
- **Image Validation**: URL validation before character upload

# External Dependencies

## Database Services

- **MTProto API**: Direct Telegram API access via Pyrogram for advanced features
- **File Storage**: Telegram's built-in file hosting for character images

## Image Hosting
- **Telegraph**: Primary image hosting service for character images
- **URL Validation**: Validates image URLs before storing in database

## Python Libraries
- **Core**: python-telegram-bot, pyrogram, motor (async MongoDB)
- **Utilities**: aiohttp, requests, python-dotenv, cachetools
- **Scheduling**: apscheduler for background tasks
- **Rate Limiting**: pyrate-limiter for API call management

## Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Config Classes**: Separate Production/Development configuration classes
